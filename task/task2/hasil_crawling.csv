This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks.

Each constituent system has its own purpose and could operate and collaborate voluntarily with other constituent systems to achieve a common goal that cannot be treated by any of them in isolation. Objective: A constituent system may be deployed or undeployed at run-time within an SoS. Emergent behaviors may be undesirable and affect the behaviors of each constituent system and lead to unexpected operations and a lack of permanent status in the SoS. Thus, we need to continuously extract and represent the actual behaviors within the SoS at run-time. Method: In this paper, we implement the first step our “Architecture Mining” approach. Thus, we monitor an SoS and develop Discovery algorithm to extract the actual behaviors. The actual behaviors are presented by a “Discovered Model” dynamically and automatically built from the execution traces. Results: To implement our approach, we applied it to a case study entitled Smart City, which is an SoS including six types of constituent systems. We extracted the actual behaviors executed at run time from the SoS execution traces, which have never been modeled in any constituent system nor expected by the designer."

These methods allow you to train the system based on historical data and identify hidden patterns that may not be obvious in traditional analysis. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict breakdowns, optimize production processes and identify anomalies in the operation of machinery. For example, with the help of training on data on the operation of equipment, you can create a model that will predict the probability of failure of a certain part under specified operating conditions."

Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations."

Traditional approaches, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and machine learning methods like support vector machines and decision trees, focus primarily on temporal data. These models, however, often fail to capture the intricate relationships within web traffic data, such as user interactions or page-to-page connections, resulting in sub-optimal predictive performance. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) address these limitations by modeling web traffic as a graph, where web pages or users are represented as nodes, and their interactions form edges. GCNs aggregate node information through graph structures, enabling the model to learn both spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in web traffic. This ability to exploit complex data relationships makes GCNs well-suited for more accurate and dynamic web traffic predictions. In this work, we propose a GCN-based framework for web traffic forecasting, incorporating multiple optimizers like Adam, RMSProp, and SGD to identify the model’s fair performance. By optimizing training through these methods, the GCN model efficiently captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in web traffic patterns. Our study highlights the potential of GCNs in elevating the accuracy and reliability of web traffic forecasting. The integration of advanced optimizers further enhances convergence and prediction efficiency, offering a more scalable solution to meet the demands of rapidly growing and complex web systems."

Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines."

Unlike controlled settings, real-world clickstreams are noisy, fragmented, and often incomplete, due to session timeouts, network issues, caching, or third-party interactions—making it difficult to reconstruct coherent user journeys. Additionally, the absence of labeled data hinders the use of supervised learning, pushing researchers toward unsupervised or heuristic-based approaches that struggle to fully capture user behavior. In this paper, we present a benchmark of embedding techniques for modeling user navigation behavior on task-oriented software. We identify distinct user behaviors across three real-world case studies. Results show that Pattern2Vec outperforms Word2Vec in capturing meaningful task-based navigation patterns, confirming its suitability for clickstream analysis."

This study advances Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research by developing and applying an integrative spatial analysis framework specifically tailored to the complexities of urban water management. Beyond its application to Mexico City, the research demonstrates how GIS can be used to fuse heterogeneous datasets, including those from SACMEX (Mexico City’s Water System), INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography), and DENUE (National Directory of Economic Units), into a unified analytical environment. Through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), spatial data mining, and clustering techniques, the study identifies critical disparities in water consumption at multiple spatial scales, from boroughs to neighborhoods. A key contribution is the implementation of a layered system architecture for managing historic spatiotemporal data, enabling dynamic visualization of consumption patterns. The findings reveal that socio-economic and demographic variables play a decisive role in shaping spatial water demand, with marginalized communities facing disproportionate challenges. While previous spatiotemporal analyses of water consumption in Mexico City have primarily focused on aggregated borough-level data or isolated socio-demographic correlations, they have often lacked multiscale integration, high-resolution neighborhood-level analysis, or interactive visualization tools to support policy development. This research addresses these limitations by providing a fine-grained, multilayered analytical approach that enhances the scientific understanding of urban water use. Beyond offering immediate policy-relevant insights for Mexico City, the methodological framework proposed here contributes to GIS research by providing a scalable, transferable approach for analyzing urban resource consumption patterns. Future work will focus on incorporating real-time data streams, expanding sector-specific analysis, and integrating additional variables and domains required for a comprehensive understanding of water dynamics. This study represents a first step toward building an adaptive, equitable, and efficient urban water management strategy."

Traditional mental health assessment methods, such as face-to-face interviews and observational techniques, are limited by several factors, including subjectivity, response delays, and high costs. To address these issues, recent research has utilized smart sensor data. Using smartphones to collect data provides valuable insights into student behavior while ensuring the privacy of the individuals involved. The transition from traditional questionnaires to sensor data has prompted the adoption of a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for a more comprehensive classification of mental health. This study investigates the relationship between behavioral attributes and mental health dimensions, using the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining and feature extraction. This method uncovers significant correlations, highlighting the close connection between mental health and behavioral data through detailed analysis. The study proposes the use of multi-task modeling to optimize information utilization and identify correlations across tasks. The introduction of the Deep Cross Network with Squeeze and Excitation Network and Progressive Layered Extraction (DC-SE-PLE), a deep learning neural network model, enhances hierarchical feature extraction and cross-task learning, significantly improving the model’s generalization and prediction accuracy."

Researchers have proposed several machine learning-driven remedies to identify Web trackers in an automated manner. While those have displayed potential, they have primarily remained as proofs-of-concept. This work extends on t.ex-Graph outlined in our previous work [ 36 ]. The aim of this model is to distinguish benign from tracking hosts by considering their centrality in the network, and data flows to them. Based on the results of our previous work, we abandoned the SLD-based approach. Consequently, we made slight modifications to the feature vector. Our classifier’s performance is comparable to its original version, and we tested its cross-browser and longitudinal performance. Our results indicate that while the cross-browser performance significantly decreases, the longitudinal performance maintains a high level."

We propose FNoDe (Faulty Node Detection), a framework that integrates application logs, performance metrics, and distributed traces into a unified graph structure to detect both the root cause and type of anomaly. By leveraging a graph convolutional network (GCN), FNoDe learns system representations under normal and anomalous states from historical microservice data and uses these embeddings to classify new system states. Evaluated on five public benchmarks and two in-house microservice systems, FNoDe outperforms traditional methods by 20–30% in accuracy and maintains competitive performance with state-of-the-art frameworks, while also offering interpretability through XAI techniques."

Among others, Google’s project “Oxygen” is an example of successfully deploying workforce analytics, which helped improve the company’s productivity and employee well-being and build up effective human resource management practices [40]. Yet, there are practical challenges that prevent workforce analytics from realizing its promise. One notable challenge is concerned with the absence of group-oriented analysis pivotal to strategy execution and organizational effectiveness [56]. For example, current workforce analytics has not yet enabled consistent comparisons across internal groups within organizations [44]."

Fairness in responsible process mining involves preventing unfair outcomes and recognizing potential biases that may arise in the different stages of process mining initiative. Acting fairly entails treating individuals equitably, irrespective of inherent or acquired characteristics such as gender, race, or disability, while ensuring compliance with legal and organizational fairness standards. While fairness in process mining has been explored in prior research, there remains a lack of conceptualization to identify, understand, and address fairness issues. To bridge this gap, we propose FairPM , a taxonomy that conceptualizes biases in process mining and the corresponding interventions to mitigate them. Our approach builds on theory adaptation as research method. It integrates an adaptation of biases and interventions from prior machine learning research into process mining. We illustrate the applicability of FairPM through three scenarios, demonstrating its relevance for both academia and industry. This research contributes to the growing field of fair process mining by providing a structured conceptualization that enables researchers and practitioners to diagnose biases and implement fairness interventions, ensuring equitable and unbiased process mining outcomes."

This paper presents efficient algorithms for FSM in complex networks, addressing the computational challenges posed by large-scale graph data. Traditional approaches often suffer from scalability issues due to the combinatorial explosion of subgraph candidates. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an optimized FSM framework leveraging advanced pruning techniques, graph compression, and parallel computing. Our approach incorporates pattern-growth strategies with heuristic search methods to improve computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods in terms of runtime and memory consumption. Additionally, we explore real-world applications, such as detecting anomalous patterns in cybersecurity networks, identifying molecular structures in drug discovery, and analyzing connectivity patterns in social networks. The results underscore the potential of efficient FSM algorithms in extracting meaningful insights from complex graph data. This research contributes to the advancement of graph mining techniques, providing a scalable and effective solution for large-scale network analysis. Future work will explore deep learning-based enhancements to further optimize FSM in dynamic and evolving graph structures."

data mining,10.1007/978-3-031-96841-9_2,Analyzing Side-Tracking of Developers Using Object-Centric Process Mining,"Managers need to analyze the software development process to pro-actively make decisions that meet quality, budget and time objectives. To aid this analysis, a number of data-driven approaches exist, which can be used for specific purposes, such as computing target key performance indicators (KPIs). In particular, process analysis techniques, like process mining, can analyze data from event logs of information systems and deliver actionable insights on how the process is conducted. However, traditional process mining techniques make strong assumptions on the structure of event logs, requiring the existence of a case identifier, used to group the traces. As a result, the output of such techniques only provides a narrow view of the reality, leading the manager towards wrong interpretations in cases of side-tracking , when a developer is involved in different processes that interleave one another. To account for these cases, we investigate the use of object-centric process mining (OCPM) to analyze software repositories. Our results help to explain performance issues by revealing the contributing factors that hinder the progress of development tasks."

In a design-science-oriented way, in this paper, elements of a new kind of AI-PM approach are outlined and demonstrated with ANN. These intend to enable (1) AI engineers to mine an ANN’s inner processes to discover its knowledge-induced behavior, realize conformance checking, e.g. w.r.t. an ANN required behavior, and improve ANN due to enhancement. To illustrate the application of this new approach, a set of novel model views and algorithms are proposed, which are demonstrated on simple example logs. Findings show that AI-PM supports the clarification of ANN behavior: As the ANN’s inner activities and knowledge generation can be mined, its non-transparent black box is unveiled and trustworthiness of ANN is supported."

By leveraging technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Average Directional Index (ADX), and Bollinger Bands, this study employs data mining techniques to automate insights from technical analysis. The 4 ft-Miner and CF-Miner procedures, implemented through the CleverMiner Python framework, were applied to Bitcoin price data spanning from 2014 to 2024. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of GUHA in identifying robust predictive patterns. Rules mined via 4 ft-Miner achieved 80.65% confidence in predicting next-day price decreases and 96.15% confidence in forecasting significant upward movements (next-day high exceeding a 1% increase over the opening price). CF-Miner further categorized price return probabilities, enhancing interpretability and revealing ordered insights into the prediction of positive returns. These results underscore GUHA’s potential to automate and enhance the efficiency of technical analysis, providing actionable intelligence for automated trading and financial risk management. By offering interpretable patterns and statistically significant relationships, the GUHA framework bridges the gap between traditional technical analysis and modern algorithmic trading strategies. Future research may extend this approach to longer-term trend predictions and multi-asset portfolios, further advancing the automation of financial market analysis."

These methods have been developed for their flexibility, allowing for easier incorporation of additional user constraints during the mining process. In this paper, we first present a symbolic approach for enumerating closed interval patterns using the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT). Then, by extending the SAT-based encoding of classical patterns with additional constraints to eliminate redundancy, our method proves to be highly efficient. Finally, experimental evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that our SAT-based framework is highly competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, even on large numerical databases."

A key success factor is the availability of appropriate digital skills in the workforce. This can be enhanced by training existing staff or hiring skilled individuals. In the latter scenario, the hiring process must focus on the required competencies. Typically, job advertisements are used to communicate job requirements. his article explores the presence of digital competencies in job ads of German public organizations. We operationalize the DigComp 2.2 framework as a category system to identify required digital competences in these job advertisements. To assess a large volume of job postings, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) for categorization. In this way, we are able to process 5,949 job advertisements. Results indicate frequent mentions of skills related to digital content creation and data handling, while communication, problem-solving, and safety are rarely highlighted. Although the reasons for this are not explicitly identified in our study, a mismatch is evident between the push for digital transformation in the public sector and the recruitment practices reflected in job advertisements."

For model-based retrievers, how to define and represent docid is a vital issue affecting retrieval performance. Existing methods lean solely on mining information from the unstructured corpus itself to generate docids, suffering from a lack of structural information to characterize document relations. To tackle this problem, we explore a novel model-based retrieval framework named KG-ASI, enhanced by an external knowledge graph. Specifically, rich structural knowledge is injected into docids through graph representation learning on a corpus-related KG subgraph as external knowledge enhancement, facilitating the end-to-end training process. Besides, to mitigate the exposure bias in query generation, we extend beyond original supervised fine-tuning by implementing a novel contrastive learning method to fine-tune the pre-trained query generation model, augmenting the quality of pseudo-queries. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of KG-ASI over strong baselines across common metrics, verifying the effectiveness of our proposed method."

This paper explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance data retrieval in modern database systems, focusing on improving query accuracy and relevance. AI-driven approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning, enable databases to better understand query intent, deliver semantically meaningful results, and adapt to user preferences. This paper also examines how AI can optimize query performance through contextual awareness, semantic search, and personalized retrieval, which go beyond conventional indexing and query optimization strategies. Additionally, it discusses real-world applications of AI-enhanced data retrieval, including search engines, recommendation systems, and intelligent database systems. While AI offers significant advantages, challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and computational scalability remain. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future of AI in database systems, highlighting emerging trends like hybrid query systems and the potential role of quantum computing in revolutionizing data retrieval processes.

ReSHQ generates hypothetical queries from documents using language models and re-ranks retrieval results based on the similarity between the input query and the hypothetical queries. Experiments using the Web search datasets (TREC DL19/20) demonstrated that ReSHQ outperformed the conventional BM25 method, particularly in nDCG@k. While ReSHQ did not surpass HyDE, a conventional method that also does not require labeled dataset training, in overall performance, it achieved comparable or superior accuracy in nDCG@1. Compared to HyDE, ReSHQ exhibited lower retrieval performance with large language models but achieved comparable or superior performance with smaller language models, indicating a reduced reliance on internal knowledge. Experiments using low-resource datasets (BEIR) showed that ReSHQ underperformed compared to BM25. However, the proposed method showed results suggesting its effectiveness in datasets with short document lengths and in question-answering tasks. These results indicate that ReSHQ is effective in Web search datasets and is a promising method, especially for smaller language models. Future challenges include improving the method of generating hypothetical queries and evaluating performance on diverse datasets."

Moreover, there is a lack of in-depth exploration of vision-language knowledge distillation schemes, failing to effectively utilize multimodal knowledge to guide the learning of student networks. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a graph-enhanced cross-modal retrieval method based on vision-language knowledge distillation (GECM-KD). This method first extracts features through CLIP and utilizes Graph Attention Networks to extract more fine-grained information from similar data nodes. By combining fine-grained features of images and text, and utilizing knowledge distillation techniques, rich semantic information is transferred from the teacher model to the student model. Additionally, a framework for vision-language knowledge distillation is designed to effectively extract detailed multimodal semantic information from the model, which is then leveraged to optimize the student network. Results from multiple datasets confirm that our approach greatly enhances both retrieval accuracy and efficiency in diverse cross-modal retrieval scenarios."
information retrieval,10.1007/978-3-031-97141-9_12,CLIP-Driven Deep Hashing for Cross-Modal Retrieval,"Cross-modal hashing focuses on learning compact binary codes to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information across different modalities. Recent advances in vision-language pretraining, especially the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in aligning visual and textual representations. However, directly integrating CLIP into hashing frameworks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose CLIP-Driven Deep Hashing (CDDH), a novel approach that leverages CLIP’s powerful multimodal representations to generate effective hash codes. Specifically, we employ CLIP’s pre-trained embeddings as feature representations and introduce a dual-stream hash learning network that refines these features for cross-modal retrieval. Our method incorporates contrastive learning, quantization constraints, and similarity-preserving objectives to enhance retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard cross-modal benchmarks, including NUS-WIDE and MIRFlickr-25K, demonstrate the better position of our method over state-of-the-art hashing approaches."

To mitigate the problem, preliminary works have attempted to extract task-relevant context from repositories to aid code generation. Nonetheless, these methods do not delve deeply enough into processing repository context information since they overlook the hierarchical and dependency relationships among contexts. Therefore, we propose a code generation method enhanced by context-dependent graph retrieval. First, we present a method for constructing a Repository Context Dependency Graph (RCDG) designed toencapsulate multiple types of code entities within a repository, along with their interdependencies. Subsequently, we propose a code generation framework enhanced by context dependency graph retrieval. Semantically related context collections are obtained through heterogeneous graph retrieval and Breadth-First Search(BFS). These collected contexts undergo a further refinement process through the use of LLMs, aiming to elevate the relevance of the retrieved contexts. Finally, we automatically construct prompts for the contexts and requirements to effectively utilize the retrieved relevant contexts, guiding the model to generate high-quality code. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms current state-of the-art methods across multiple metrics."

In Vietnam, legal documents are characterized by complex structures, specialized terminology, and intricate content relationships, creating significant challenges for efficient information processing. This study presents the Graph RAG system, an innovative knowledge graph based approach designed to improve the retrieval and synthesis of information from Vietnamese legal texts. By ensuring high accuracy and thorough analysis in legal decision making, this work pushes forward the use of natural language processing (NLP) in the legal domain. The Graph RAG system was built using six Vietnamese legal codes as its core dataset. We utilized the Neo4j graph database to organize and visualize legal information, effectively capturing entities and their relationships. A key feature of our approach was the development of custom prompts tailored to legal contexts, enabling precise identification of concepts and their connections. This was refined through iterative visualization and validation in Neo4j to ensure the knowledge graph’s accuracy and usefulness. We evaluated Graph RAG by comparing it to traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods using two datasets: one with multiple choice questions and another with open-ended queries. Performance was measured through metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) for retrieval relevance, Answer Relevancy Score (ARS) for response quality, and accuracy for multiple-choice answers. The results show that Graph RAG outperforms conventional RAG, with a 14.05% increase in retrieval relevance (NDCG), a 4.34% boost in accuracy, and enhanced ability to handle complex legal information. This research contributes to the exploration and future implementation of RAG systems in addressing administrative and legal tasks in Vietnam."

Existing search engines conduct music tracks matching via coarse-granularity retrieval of metadata, such as natural language queries including pre-defined tags and genres. However, such retrieval methods often encounter difficulties while handling fine-granularity queries on contexts. We aim to address fine-granularity music retrieval issue in this work. We construct a dataset with 66,048 image-music pairs for cross-modal music retrieval task. A modality-joint embedding space is learned, where hybrid-granularity context-alignment between images and music is considered via contrastive learning. Additionally, contrastive learning losses on hybrid-granularity contexts are designed to ensure image-music alignment in both inter-modal and intra-modal scenarios. The proposed approach is evaluated through experiments, which demonstrate that our method successfully aligns images and music, and outperforms previous methods in terms of cross-modal music retrieval tasks (image-to-music and music-to-image). Codes ( https://blossomers.github.io/ ) will be available for public."

In this work, we aim to better understand the use of context for medical image retrieval. To this end, we propose a novel context-switching-based medical image retrieval framework. Our approach uses the MedSAM2 foundation model to extract segmentations and generate three distinct input versions of each image: the original image, the region-of-interest (ROI) image, and a bounding box around the region of interest that captures additional contextual information. We generate the corresponding embeddings using a contrastive loss-based metric learning approach. A selective backpropagation mechanism enables the model to dynamically identify and utilize the most informative feature embedding for retrieval. Our results suggest that the general context is often more beneficial than a specific context for accurate image retrieval. Our proposed method is evaluated on the ISIC17 and COVID-QU-Ex chest X-ray datasets and demonstrates superior performance compared to strongly related baselines."

SlideVQA requires complex reasoning abilities, such as understanding relationships between multiple document images and numerical reasoning. Conventional methods have demonstrated significantly lower performance in multi-hop question answering than simple single-hop. Specifically, one instance has shown a performance drop of over 10 points in the F1 score, indicating insufficient performance. Furthermore, while conventional studies have demonstrated that accurate evidence selection improves overall task performance, there remains room for improvement. This paper focuses on improving the performance of multi-hop question answering and evidence selection in the SlideVQA task, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the question-answering task. To this end, we propose Multimodal Beam Retrieval (MMBR), a multimodal extension of Beam Retrieval, a retriever for answering multi-hop questions on text documents. Through experiments using the SlideVQA dataset, we aim to clarify whether the proposed method improves the performance of evidence selection and contributes to the overall performance enhancement of the question-answering task."
